Show any feed content as your own post content in WP

== Description ==

WordPress plugin to publish virtual posts from any feed.
Instead of post copies this plugin will create it's own "virtual" posts and show the RSS-content as a post in WP.

In our case we will use this plugin to show content from other sites in another site without copy the content.

2. Activate Virtual Posts through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Add feeds to Settings->Virtual Posts
